<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project aims at digging deeper into global ecological trends, to find insightful patterns that affect the overall production and consumption of resources. It will focus on learning trends within real time data that can be easily visualized for a better understanding of how a country can achieve equilibrium. It will help the globe get an understanding where we stand in terms of sustainability. This will be achieved through efficient machine learning models that can make predictions for a country’s ecological footprint based on how resources are being utilized currently.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The FetchData folder sontains the python script that fetches data from the * [API endpoints](https://data.footprintnetwork.org/#/api) provided by Global Footprint Network. This script was used to fetch data for countries through the years 2015 to 2018.
The Evaluation1 folder contains the Data folder, which holds the different datasets that were created and also the 4 notebooks used to create these datasets and also ML models.

More details to be added as the project is continued.
